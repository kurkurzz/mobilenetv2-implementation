## Implementation of MobileNetV2

Implemented MobileNetV2 model from scratch based on paper **[MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)** (Sandler et al., 2018). It's part of my deep learning process.

Guided by official code from pytorch vision: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/mobilenetv2.py

also thanks to https://madebyollin.github.io/convnet-calculator/ for calculator to calculate the convulational layers parameters.
